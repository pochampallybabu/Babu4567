We have created an python application on random password generator in this we will generated a random password using based on type of their needs the password will generate in the form of characters numbers so on etc the password will generate in the form of encrypted and decrypted using rsa in this project in this the user will select password in the form of characters or numbers when the user click on generate password the password will be generate when we click on generate key using rsa the password will be encrypted in form of rsa. In this we project we use random module to generate random numbers lists and string and string module used for characters or strings and cryptography module is used for generating fernet keys and algorithms like messages and digests and rsa module is used for implementing encryption decryption and signatures. Python Version:3.11 Operating System:Windows 8 64 bit
